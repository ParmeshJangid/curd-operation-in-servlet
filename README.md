### CRUD Operation in Servlet
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Java Servlets. The application allows users to interact with a backend database to perform various operations on a resource (such as user data). This application is intended to provide a basic understanding of how to handle HTTP requests in Servlets and how to interact with databases.

### Project Overview
This project is built using:

### Java
Servlets for handling HTTP requests
### JDBC 
for connecting and interacting with the database
### MySQL (or any other relational database) for storing data
### Features
Create: Allows users to add new records.

Read: Displays records from the database.

Update: Modifies existing records.

Delete: Removes records from the database.

### Technologies Used

Java 8

Servlet API

JDBC

MySQL Database (or any database of your choice)

Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container

Setting Up the Project
### Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/ParmeshJangid/curd-operation-in-servlet)
### Configure the database:

Create a MySQL database and configure it with necessary tables.
Update the database.properties file with the database credentials (username, password, URL).
### Deploy the project on a Servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat):

If you're using Apache Tomcat, place the WAR file in the webapps directory.
Start the Tomcat server.
### Access the application:

The application is hosted locally on your machine, and you can access the CRUD operations by visiting the following URL:

git clone https://github.com/ParmeshJangid/curd-operation-in-servlet
